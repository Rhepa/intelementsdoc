			<h2>Inspiration/Process</h2>
			<p>
			I’ve been assigned the show/hide elements for this assignment. The show/hide element is a very common element used in a lot of websites and on the internet. For example, the show/hide element is used for showing your password or hide on websites. Or when you might be reading an article and it says “More” and it shows you the rest of the reading. These are just some of the examples and there are many more ways you can use these elements.

			For this assignment, I was thinking of ways I could use the show/hide element. At first, I followed the modules tutorial, and when I implemented the hide/show button, it simply just hid the shapes. I wasn’t satisfied, because literally all you did was click on the shape for the form to become abstract, then click the hide/show button to just hide and click it again to show the shapes in abstract form.

			So as I played around with the code, I managed to make the shape itself hide when clicked on it. I liked that idea. As I continued, I made the hide/show button into just a show button, where it shows up all the abstract shapes that the user hid.  That is my final outcome, and the rest I focused on the aesthetics such as animations, colors and layout.

				I wanted a black background so the colors would pop out more. I lowered the opacity of the shapes so we could see the shapes overlaying each other, making it more abstract. Accidentally, I gave a hover effect that leaves a trail of the colors changing making it colorful.
